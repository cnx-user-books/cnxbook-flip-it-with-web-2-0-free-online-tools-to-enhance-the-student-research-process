  <md:title>FLIP It with Web 2.0 - Free Online Tools to Enhance the Student Research Process, Part III - INPUT/INVESTIGATE/IMPLEMENT</md:title>
  <md:abstract>FLIP It! (TM) was developed by librarian and educator Alice H. Yucht as a set of reflective questions to guide learners throughout the information process. It serves as a clear and concise framework upon which to structure the basic student research task. <emphasis>The acronym FLIP it! stands for- F- FOCUS: Specifying the Topic L- LINK/LOCATE: Strategizing the Process I- INPUT/INVESTIGATE/IMPLEMENT: Sorting, Sifting, and Storing the Data P- PRODUCE/PRESENT/PAYOFF: Solving and Showing the Results IT! - the Intelligent Thinking Needed Every Step of the Way. </emphasis> More detailed information may be found on Alice Yucht's website at  http://www.aliceinfo.org/flipit/ The four modules in this collection will lead students through this four-step process and introduce them to free online tools and services that can aid and enhance the research pursuits. These Web 2.0 advances give today's students new ways to formulate, organize, collaborate, attribute, preserve, and share their research. This is Part III - INPUT/INVESTIGATE/IMPLEMENT. Students will be introduced to several free online tools and services that can aid in the intermediate stages of research projects - those tasks that IMPLEMENT the project's sources and lead to the creation of the final project.
Links are included to all websites and Flash demonstrations will lead students through possible uses of these tools. To complete the full collection of four modules, students should take the linked pre-test first (printable document),work sequentially through Parts I,II,III, and IV, do the suggested activities that accompany each part, and then complete the post-test (printable document).</md:abstract>

<section id="eip-357"><title>Think About....</title><para id="eip-780">As you are introduced to these online sites, services, and tools, there are some important things to keep in mind. There may be alternatives to each that you prefer over the tools presented here. If you use others and find them effective, by all means keep using them! Also, an effort was made to include only free services, but pricing models can change. Features can evolve and change. None of these tools should be relied on without your involvement, understanding, and input. Be critical of these tools and rely on your own knowledge of your assignments as well as that of your fellow students and instructors. There are times when your research can benefit from face-to-face resources rather than online/virtual options. Web 2.0 is about choice and we hope to present you with some here that can enhance, not replace, methods and tools that you already use or that your instructor requires.</para></section><section id="eip-57"><title>Try the Tools!
